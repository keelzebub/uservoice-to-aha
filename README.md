# UserVoice to Aha Migration w/ Salesforce
When trying to migrate my company's data from UserVoice to Aha, I ran into a couple issues; specifically, Aha's automatic migration doesn't preserve the existing Salesforce links, and UserVoice's Salesforce integration adds every single Salesforce contact to UserVoice (even if they haven't interacted with UserVoice).

This script selectively migrates contacts from UserVoice to Aha, as well as preserves the feature requests' links to Salesforce. It was written based on the Aha article [Link Aha! Roadmaps and Salesforce records in bulk (Advanced plan)
](https://www.aha.io/support/roadmaps/integrations/salesforce/bulk-link-aha-roadmaps-salesforce-records).

_Note: UserVoice calls feature requests "suggestions" and Aha calls feature requests "Ideas"â€”I will just be using the term "feature requests" in the README to avoid confusion._

## What It Does
Running this script will do a few key things:

- Pull down all relevant data from UserVoice and store it in the `./tmp` folder.
- Migrate all users from UserVoice that have submitted or voted on a feature request (and maintain their link to their Salesforce Account).
- Migrate all feature requests that haven't been deleted or are marked as spam.
- Migrate all votes on feature requests.
- Migrate all comments on feature requests.
- Migrate all proxy votes (known as "feedback requests" on UserVoice), preserving their links to Salesforce.
- Merge any feature requests in Aha that were previously merged in UserVoice.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ruby installed (version 3.0.4 recommended)
- Add the Salesforce integration to Aha and allow time for SF Accounts to migrate over to Aha.
- Create an Aha Idea Portal that will be associated with your migrated ideas.
  - Turn off email notifications on the Idea Portal to prevent spamming your customers with a bunch of "thank you for submitting an idea!" emails when the feature requests are migrated over.
  - Enable SSO on your portal (doesn't have to actually work) to prevent spamming your customers with a bunch of "create a password" emails when they are migrated over.
- Create a fallback user that will be used in the instance that a contact doesn't exist
  - The fallback user should exist in Salesforce and also as an Aha portal user.

### Running the Migration
- Install the required gems: `bundle install`
- Fill out the configuration details (see the "Configuration" section below)
- Run the script: `ruby ./migration.rb`

After the script finishes running, navigate to the Salesforce integration in Aha and trigger a record update to sync all mapped from Salesforce (Account Settings -> Integrations -> [your Salesforce Integration] -> Update records).

### Configuration
Copy `config-example.yml` to `config.yml` and fill out the configuration items in `config.yml`.
